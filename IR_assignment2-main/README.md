### Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a Ranked Retrieval System using the Vector Space Model (VSM). The VSM computes document relevance based on cosine similarity between free-text queries and documents. The ranking is based on tf-idf (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) weighting, and documents are normalized using cosine normalization.
